## 2021 ##
Proving challenging to keep this updated throughout the pandemic!
### -> May ###
* Big news - I received an [NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2109790)! I will be studying the relationship between mathematical modeling parametric variability and phenotypic plasticity. 
*  New preprint: [Overcoming the challenges to enhancing experimental plant biology with computational modeling](https://osf.io/jfdb9/)! Will be published soon. This was my first time leading a review, and it was both challenging and rewarding to work with so many people at once. Many of the authors are involved in the Modeling and Beyond community too. 
*  I received an Education and Outreach grant from the [Society for Mathematical Biology](https://www.smb.org/) to develop another educational video game! This has a similar theme as the larger game I am developing with the ASPB funds, but highlights different concepts. Will be debuting this summer!

## 2020 ##

### February - September ###
Been a few months since I updated, I think we all know why ... 
* Collaborative incubator website [InitMathBio](https://initmathbio.com) is finally up! I never thought I'd actually complete it.. chalk it up to quarantine free time. More soon!
* I received a grant to develop an educational video game from ASPB! So excited to see this come to life, and hopefuly help others overcome math anxiety through seeing the magic of math! Check out my interview on the [Danforth Center blog](https://www.danforthcenter.org/news/plant-science-meets-gaming-scientists-begin-developing-math-and-plant-biology-video-game/). I'll be doing my own writeup soon, maybe even with a demo!
* Myself and Dr Amogh Jalihal have started an online [community for early-career modelers](https://amoghpj.github.io/modeling-and-beyond/). You can read more about our vision for this community on my blog: https://iambecomecomputational.com/2020/07/01/modeling-and-beyond/
* The workshop continued to be held for the online PlantBiology meeting in late July. We found that an in-person format would be better for what we had planned (a little too many surveys). Check out the [materials and outline here.](https://www.initmathbio.com/pb2020-introduction-to-modeling/)
* I've been developing a searchable database for [DivsersifyPlantScience!](https://rdale1.shinyapps.io/diversifyplantsci/)
* I talked about one of my postdoctoral research projects at the PB2020 online meeting - [check out my abstract](https://www.eventscribe.com/2020/ASPB/fsPopup.asp?Mode=presInfo&PresentationID=742032) - I'm overly optimistic in my productivity, and hoping to have something out soon.... 
* In March, right before lockdown, I attended the [QCB Cell Modeling Workshop](https://qcbnet.ucsf.edu/attendee-application-page-hackathon-vi) in California! I worked with the [soon-to-be Dr. Yan Gong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yan-gong-0a51ba45) - although it was his first collaboration with a modeler, the communication was on point, and we nearly completed an entire model! Hope to share this work soon. 
* At the same workshop, I also did another test-run of my collaborative matching program, this time on a very diverse group of modelers and experimentalists. We found that it did about as well as hand-matching, but significantly easier on the organizers. Hope to share a writeup and code on this soon. 

### January ###
* My workshop for PB2020, "Discovering the rules of life through computational plant biology â€“ utilizing
    dynamical mathematical models", was accepted! [Learn more here](https://iambecomecomputational.wordpress.com/2020/01/21/workshop-on-computational-plant-biology-at-pb2020-opportunities-for-participants/)
* My paper "Modeling and analysis of the firefly luciferase reaction and a G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway with ordinary differential equations increases self confidence in mathematical cell biology for novice graduate students" was accepted for publication in *Letters in Biomathematics*! That makes 11.
